Program to learn about how search indexing works for big data. Google used MapReduce in 2004 to 2010. 

Uses a sitemap from SU to retrieve all the available courses and its information. 

Working on implementing a simulation of MapReduce and its functionality. 

Will be using it for implementing a search index program ( mini google ).
